      <p><p>(From the New York Times Sunday magazine)</p>

<p>The first electric toaster appeared in 1909. It toasted one side at a time and required constant vigilance: when the toast was done, you pulled the plug. The first automatic electric toaster was designed in 1919 by Charles Strite, a man sick and tired of burned toast. Americans were skeptical at first about investing in a single-function appliance, but prices dropped and &#8211; such is the allure of toasted bread &#8211; sales mushroomed. From 1922 to 1930 sales tripled, from 400,000 units to 1,200,000, thanks in part to the introduction of sliced bread by Wonder. Toasters now live in 88 percent of American homes; the tiny chrome hearth on the counter may well be the one object that pleases most of the people most of the time.</p></p>

<p>HELLO, AND WELCOME,</p>

<p>As a member of Toastmasters International I shall speak to you a speech. On toast. And of it&#8217;s mysteries.</p>

<p>My speech begins as thus:</p>

<p>People will fear the many things they do not understand. Some do not understand war or perhaps the beauty seen from a really good height. Some fear spiders. For others, of too great a number, it is toast.</p>

<p>But what is it that urges these sorry souls to consume (not only at breakfast, but all times of the day) their own heart-weakening horror? Um, they&#8217;re probably hungry. Still, it is only in education that people will quell there mad, mad, madness.</p>

<p>You know how bread will sit and either become A:really moldy or B:old and crusty? (hhmmm&#8230;kinda like people I guess. maybe this is the root of the fear) This is due to the aging of bread. Yet we come to A or B in different enviroments; where A will become edibly unattractive, B becomes very much like toast. Thus, the obvious answer is that the toaster is a &#8216;Flash-Aging Device&#8217;.</p>

<p>Now hear me out. The toaster is a unit of toasting technology which, within it&#8217;s walls, speeds up time for whatever may be present. When we add a bread product (read: pre-pubescant toast) we bombard it with the energy of time travel producing bread type B. So much heat is spent in time travel that we receive a toast with a nice tan (depending on how far we age it)</p>

<p>And there you have it. Personally I joined Toastmaster International for the obvious reason. To meet women. However I&#8217;m happy to say that due to being a better speaker, I have found the strength to face my fears. I am a master of toast it is true, of 53 different types of toast found all over the world.</p>

<p>Thank you. God bless and good night.</p></p>

      <span class='entry-meta'>posted August 10, 2005 | <a href="/departments/toast-articles/">toast-articles</a></span>
      <p><p>by Vanessa Jones<br /> Academic Psychiatry<br /> Imperial College School of Medicine (St.Mary&#8217;s)</p>

<p>Here is a way of making toast that is also a race:</p>

<p>ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>bread</li>

<li>marge/butter</li>

<li>marmite</li>

<li>processed cheese slices</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the toast in the toaster. As soon as this is done start getting all you other ingredients ready, ie marge and cheese out of fridge, marmite open, cheese slices unwrapped etc. As soon as the toast pops up prepare as fast as possible with marge, marmite and then cheese slices. The aim of the game is to get your cheese slices to melt from the heat of the bread. (but you can always cheat by using a microwave or grill for a few seconds).</p>

<p>This recipe should actually be credited to Neil Aldis. I hope other readers of your educational and informative web site will appreciate this recipe/game/race</p>

<p>TOAST has its fans on the Internet. You can find dozens of sites dedicated to the morning comfort food. Here are some of the highlights from the Toast Resources site, http://dsp.com/tritone/toastlinks.html (ed. note: moved to http://www.drtoast.com)</p>

<p>TravlToast is a portable toaster that can be plugged into a car&#8217;s cigarette lighter to make a batch of toast while you are commuting to work.</p>

<p>Toasters are part of tour promotion materials for the popular rock group Pearl Jam.</p>

<p>There is even a series of toast haiku on the Internet, following the traditional Japanese form of poetry. A few entries:</p>

<p>&#8220;With sun&#8217;s early rise,<br /> The toasting is the reason<br /> Worth opening eyes&#8221;<br /> &#8211; Rae Anne Lafrenz</p>

<p>&#8220;Angry toastless man<br /> Malfunctioning appliance<br /> Senseless killing spree&#8221;<br /> &#8211; James Reynolds</p>

<p>&#8220;I am toast. My crunch<br /> Makes your mouth smile. Woe is he<br /> Who microwaves me&#8221;<br /> &#8211; Shad Emerson Jessen</p></p>

      <p><p>Celebrating the invention and perfection of one of life&#8217;s truly golden pleasures</p>

<p>by Bob Condor<br /> Chicago Tribune</p>

<p>THE EVERYDAY slice of toast is not without its celebrity interludes. As Sir John Falstaff calls for more drinks at a high point of frivolity in Shakespeare&#8217;s &#8220;The Merry Wives of Windsor,&#8221; he yells after the server, &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget the toast!&#8221; Falstaff was asking for the cube of hot buttered toast traditionally tossed into warm drinks in the heyday of the Bard, leading to the use of the word &#8220;toast&#8221; as a way to celebrate life&#8217;s most important moments.</p>

<p>One hundred years ago, legendary Parisian chef Auguste Escoffier of the Ritz Hotel created a thinly slice piece of toast for a finicky but beloved Australian opera singer who refused to eat her pâté on the usual thick slice of bread. The diva&#8217;s name was Nellie Melba, and you know what food she inspired (more than 2 billion slices were sold worldwide in 1996).</p>

<p>But star power isn&#8217;t what inspired the presence of toasters in 88 percent of U.S. households. Toasted bread pretty much sells itself. Like a good neighbor or cheerful co-worker, toast can make life richer without much fanfare.</p>

<p>For one thing, toast certainly brings out the best in most breads. Even the drab slice of a mass-produced white loaf improves in taste when heated to about 310 degrees Farenheit, producing a chemical change known as the Maillard reaction, caramelizing the sugars and starches while browning the bread. Other breads, especially whole grains and certain ryes, have textures and tastes seemingly ready-made for toast, picking up intense flavor after descent into the toaster.</p>

<p>Something is clearly missing at breakfast without a side dish of toast, and it&#8217;s not only about taste.</p>

<p>Marion Cunningham, author of &#8220;The Breakfast Book,&#8221; attests to the &#8220;deep grainy&#8221; flavors and textures of toast that she prefers to be &#8220;evenly golden&#8221; (which she said is better attained using your broiler instead of the toaster). Her endorsement covers taste, touch and sight to go along with what she calls the &#8220;irresistible fragrance&#8221; of toast.</p>

<p>Though good bread (especially denser varieties) makes good toast, its smell is rated with the equally tantalizing morning aromas of brewing coffee and frying bacon &#8211; so wondrous that some aficionados claim the actual piece of toast can&#8217;t possibly live up to its olfactory billing.</p>

<p>Crisp, not limp</p>

<p>But perfection is possible, if the bread is toasted properly, said Men&#8217;s Journal columnist Glen Wagoner, a native Texan who travels the country searching out new recipes for comfort food. &#8220;The problem with toast in most American diners and restaurants is it is not toasted enough. Too many people can&#8217;t distinguish the difference between warmed bread and proper toast. It should be crisp, not limp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearly attending to the priority of butter with toast in this low-cal crazed world are writers Jane and Michael Stern, America&#8217;s foremost experts on diner foods. &#8220;It is absolutely necessary to plan ahead when preparing buttered toast,&#8221; they write in &#8220;Square Meals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that it will be perfectly spreadable, butter must be out of the refrigerator at least one hour before the bread is toasted. For spur-of-the-moment toast, it will be best to use a sharp knife to &#8216;peel&#8217; thin leaves of butter off the top of a stick (or, better yet, a one-pound block), and place these leaves on the hot toast to melt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trying to spread a cold pat of butter on warm toast is a nightmare. If the toast doesn&#8217;t tear altogether, the press of the butter knife will bruise and batter the surface beyond the bounds of acceptable comfort food.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once safely past any butter imbroglios, there are many topping options beyond the traditional and tasty jellies, jams, preserves, peanut butter and, seemingly everyone&#8217;s childhood favorite, a sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar. The Sterns suggest a touch of orange rind and orange juice added to the butter, maybe a few raisins or shredded coconut. Cunningham recommends crumbled sausage with applesauce, apples and melted cheese, ham and nutmeg, bananas cooked in butter, warmed tomatoes and smoked salmon.</p>

<p>Sweet treat</p>

<p>Then there&#8217;s milk toast, what you might mistakenly consider the dullard of all recipes when, in fact, none other than the late, great food writer M.F.K. Fisher listed it under &#8220;R&#8221; for Romantic in her classic book, &#8220;The Art of Eating.&#8221; It is basically toasted bread in a bowl with milk, sweet butter, salt and pepper, but it was manna for Fisher.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a warm, mild, soothing thing, full of innocent strength,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;It is a small modern miracle of gastronomy.&#8221;</p></p>

      <span class='entry-meta'>posted August 10, 2005 | <a href="/departments/toast-articles/">toast-articles</a></span>
      <p><p>by Alan Burdick<br /> New York Times</p>

<p>Not long ago I was given a toaster as a gift. For years I lived without one. Toasting, it seemed to me, was a sham: in goes the pre-sliced slip of machine-molded white bread, and out pops a pretense of royalty, an impostor to the throne of cakes and jam and tea. The toaster &#8211; invented, I&#8217;d always thought, expressly to facilitate this sorry masquerade &#8211; was to blame.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;ve changed my views. Partly it&#8217;s my toaster: chrome, sleek, a jewel from the 1950&#8217;s &#8211; that era when household appliances were an art form, when their design seemed to say, something sacred is taking place here. And partly it&#8217;s a better understanding of history. Wonder Bread, the predecessor and king of all packaged sliced bread, was not introduced in sliced form until 1930, more than a decade after the world&#8217;s first automatic toasting device (eventually called the Toastmaster toaster, the brand that now blesses my faux-wood-laminated counter) was patented. Sliced bread was literally made to e toasted.</p>

<p>In essence, I see now, each individual slice of American bread carries within itself the seeds of its own redemption. Just as every American child may grow to be President, so does every slice of bread, no matter how airy, white and characterless, offer the golden promise of toast. Only circumstance &#8211; the lack of a toaster, in this case &#8211; hinders the fulfillment of this promise.</p>

<p>To toast, then, is to ritually re-enact, daily and in miniature, the American dream itself. Each morning, in a small corner of the kitchen, the transformation of bread into cake prefigures (we hope) our own successful assault upon the social ladder. It is as if, by toasting, we ourselves might be toasted.</p>

<p>Toast thus serves as a talismanic reminder of human potential. To the Willy Lomans and Ralph Kramdens of the world, destined as they are to ashen lives, an encounter with toast can never be more than a tragic experience. To the rest of us, it is a call to arms. The bell sounds, the toast springs up, the scnt of a golden future wafts before us like an omen. Time now to go to work.</p></p>
