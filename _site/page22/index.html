      <p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Dr. Toast, your knowledge of the toaster astounds and amazes me. How did you come to learn so much about toast?</p>

<p>&#8211; An Inquiring Mind (mango@xxxxx.edu)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> This is a subject I find somewhat difficult to talk about, but because of its therapeutic value, I&#8217;ll tell you, Inquiring Mind. In 1982, when I was in the second grade, I was struck in the head by a large piece of toasted sourdough bread traveling at a high velocity (presumably ejected from a toaster by Satan). The toast lodged just below my left frontal lobe, and I fell into a deep coma. Because of the precarious placement of the toast, the doctors were afraid to remove it for fear of causing further damage. My family and friends stood nearby, waiting for the inevitable. Little did they know, however, that all of the wisdom and power of generations of toast was slowly seeping into my young, absorbent mind. When I miraculously awoke three months later, the toast was gone, my head had healed, and I had become Dr. Toast. It was a traumatic experience for a second grader, but through the years my place in the world has become clear to me.</p>

<p>I Toast, Therefore I Am.</p>

      <span class='entry-meta'>posted April 3, 1996 | <a href="/departments/ask-dr-toast/">ask-dr-toast</a></span>
      <p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Dr. Toast, my toaster displays the alarming syndrome in which my toast is shot across the room, often to distances reaching up to 3 or 4 feet. If I am not present when this occurs, I have to waste my time hunting for the toast in some obscure corner of the room. This disturbs me. Is there anything that can be done?</p>

<p>&#8211; Jennifer (j@xxxxx.com)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Jennifer, it&#8217;s really quite simple. Your toaster has been possessed by Satan. While you should feel honored that the Prince of Darkness himself has chosen one of your household appliances as his earthly incarnation, the repercussions, in terms of toast, are not good. Obviously, a toaster is an extremely cramped living environment for someone who is accustomed to the spoils that go along with the position of Evil Overlord. So he does what any sensible Demon Master would do: Evict the Toast! And with a vengeance, apparently.</p>

<p>What you need to do, Jennifer, is convince the Vile Displacer of Toast that he has an overwhelming desire to upgrade to a more spacious appliance, preferably one that you don&#8217;t use often, and preferably one in a somewhat secluded part of the house so you won&#8217;t be too bothered by the incessant screams of tortured souls. The &#8220;Salad-Shooter&#8221; that most of us have tucked away in some dank corner of the kitchen would be a prime candidate, were it not for the size limitation. However, the &#8220;Salad-Shooter Professional Model&#8221; would be perfectly adequate.</p>

      <h3 class='entry-title'><a href="/1996/04/02/one-slice-only">One Slice Only</a></h3>
      <span class='entry-meta'>posted April 2, 1996 | <a href="/departments/ask-dr-toast/">ask-dr-toast</a></span>
      <p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why does my toaster (and several others that I&#8217;ve encountered) have a designated slot for &#8220;One Slice Only&#8221;? Doesn&#8217;t that exclude the other slot from its share of the toasting? What right does the manufacturer have to arbitrarily choose one side to have all the single toastings while the other side only gets a slice of bread as a leftover from the &#8220;One Slice&#8221; side&#8217;s overabundance?</p>

<p>It just doesn&#8217;t seem fair!</p>

<p>&#8211; Alissa (mango@xxxxx.edu)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Well, I&#8217;ll tell you, Alissa. It has to do with the &#8220;Electron Anxiety&#8221; effect. You see, electrons are extremely nervous little critters. They are quite comfortable while they are safely within the power lines that are suspended above our streets and run through the walls in our homes. However, once they enter a household appliance, major or minor, they become extremely nervous and, frankly, somewhat homesick. They experience an overwhelming desire to retreat to safety as quickly as possible. Unless, of course, there is a nice comforting slice of raw toast (a.k.a. &#8220;bread&#8221;) nearby.</p>

<p>For economic reasons too complicated to state here, toasters are configured with the power cord entering the device on the side, closer to one slice than the other. When two slices of raw toast are present, the electrons, sensing the positive balanced karma radiating from the raw toast, are comfortable enough to roam freely throughout the appliance, generally distributing themselves evenly on both sides of the toaster. However, when only one slice of raw toast is present, half of the toaster becomes a barren environment that is extremely inhospitable to homesick electrons. If this raw-toast-less gap were on the side where the power cord enters, the electrons would enter the appliance from the end of the cord, witness the shocking void directly before them, and promptly retreat to the sanctity of the wiring in your kitchen, huddling and biding their time until they were called for the next potential toasting.</p>

<p>Therefore, the toaster manufacturers put the &#8220;One Slice Only&#8221; side nearest the power cord. The electrons enter the appliance and are greeted with a beautiful, welcoming slice of raw toast which they don&#8217;t hesitate to surround and bathe with their toastifying magic.</p>
