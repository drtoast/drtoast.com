      <span class='entry-meta'>posted November 29, 1996</span>
      <p>Q: Why are you not Dr. Toast in Bolivia? Is Dr. Toast trademarked there? Does your degree in all things toast not translate into Latin cultures? Do you ever wonder why a cold-fusion toaster would be a bad thing?

-- Yours in toast, Katie (avatrice@xxxxx.net)
<!--more-->

(ed. note: Katie is referring to the copyright disclaimer at the bottom of the page.)

A: Katie, your sharp eyes have uncovered another dark, obscure bit of Dr. Toast's past, a past which haunts him even today in his copyright disclaimers.

In the summer of 1984, I was a ten-year-old child who had received the gift of amazing toast intellect just two years earlier. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the CIA learned of my powers, and one sweltering July day they did.

They caught up with me in a cafe in the North Beach district of San Francisco, where I was standing on the small black plywood stage, a young prophet preaching the word of toast to the disheveled masses gathered around me. Before anyone knew what was happening, men in dark glasses and sharp suits rushed in and hustled me off into a waiting van.

John Burton was the local CIA operative who filled me in as we drove towards the airport. Seems they needed my superhuman intellect to crush a powerful ring of government-sponsored toast smugglers working out of Bolivia, flying their goods out of the country in cargo planes provided by the Honduran military in exchange for a cut of the profits. "You can't make me do jack," I muttered as I snubbed my cigarette into the upholstery. "Is that so?" sneered Burton.

He reached into his raincoat and slowly withdrew a fresh loaf of Home-Pride brand buttertop wheat bread. He untwisted the twistie sadistically and, savoring the look of terror on my face, began tossing slices out of the van's window, one by one. "Enough!" I cried. "I'll do your dirtywork."

I stepped off of the plane in the Bolivian capital of Sucre, in the Chuquisaca region. The air was so thick you almost needed gills and fins. It was hard to imagine a crispy slice of toast originating in such an inhospitable environment, but everyone knows this is where you buy the good stuff. Comes from climate-controlled warehouses deep in central Bolivia. A multi-billion-dollar industry.

As my Bolivian contact, Mario Villegas, drove our jeep along the muddy road to our destination, I opened the manilla envelope Burton had given me and started to read. The center of the operation was a fortified government lab deep in the rainforest between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz in central Bolivia. The local townspeople were virtual slave laborers for the government, sorting and packing the precious commodity. If they refused to work, the government cut the power to their homes, rendering their toasters useless. The very thought gives me chills to this day.

Soon after nightfall, Villegas stopped the jeep about two miles from the lab. We would make our final approach on foot under cover of darkness. "I've gotta quit smoking," I wheezed as I hacked through the vines with my machete. "Here, have a slice of toast," Villegas offered. Not surprisingly, it was the good stuff. My stamina restored, we pressed onwards.

We were close. The glimmer of floodlamps began to flash through the swaying foliage from time to time. When we finally came to the chain-link and razorwire fence at the perimeter of the compound, Villegas was as shocked as I. "The ruins of an ancient Tiahuanacan temple? So far from Lake Titicaca?" I exclaimed. "It seems our government has many secrets," mumbled Villegas.

Military vehicles were lined up by the edges of the temple, not far from a large circular area which was inscribed with strange ancient characters, pointing inwards. The large character at the center looked somehow familiar: a square with a bulging, uneven top. Couldn't quite place it. The circular area was brightly illuminated with floodlamps, and men in fatigues lounged by the vehicles. "It looks like they're waiting for something," I whispered.

As I tried to light another cigarette, a sudden breeze hindered my efforts. The breeze grew, and soon a low whirring noise became noticeable. As colored light began to bathe the entire area, Villegas and I slowly tilted our heads back, only to be practically blinded by the phantasmagorical display that was descending from the heavens.

The lights swirled and danced on the temple and forest as the enormous spacecraft approached the landing area. After the soft thud of contact, a door quietly slid open.

The smell of toast was overwhelming.

Dozens of small, spindly creatures formed a line going from the craft along the ramp to the ground and, fire-brigade style, began passing along slices of hot, crisp toast and placing it in neat symmetrical stacks on the tarmac. The eyes of the military men glittered with greed as they watched the slowly accumulating bounty.

Immediately, my hyper-intelligent toast intellect put two and two together. I grabbed Villegas' shoulder. "Do you realize what's happening here?" I trembled as rage swelled up within me. "These extraterrestrials were the benefactors of the ancient Tiahuanacan people. Lacking electricity, the Tiahuanacans had no way to make toast. It was a dire need that was generously filled by the technologically advanced aliens, but now the well-meaning creatures are unaware that the Tiahuanacan civilization disappeared eight hundred years ago! They continue their timely deliveries of toast, which are snapped up by these money-grubbing fiends!"

I could contain myself no longer. I had to end this charade. Before Villegas could stop me, I scrambled clumsily over the razor wire and made a dash for the landing area. "Benevolent creatures! Your generosity is being wasted!" I yelled as I ran. "The Tiahuanacans are -- " Two large men in fatigues cut the thought short as they threw me down and pinned me by my bloodied arms, knocking me breathless. The aliens, startled by the commotion, hastily left in a swirling vortex of dust and light. In retrospect, they probably didn't speak English, anyway.

One of the men produced a .45 which he placed to my head. His partner stopped him, pointing to the name tag I was fortunately wearing. "Hello, My Name Is: Dr. Toast, CIA". They knew the CIA signed their paychecks for a number of covert operations, and that to dispose of Dr. Toast would be a bad career move.

After my release, the Bolivian government, in cooperation with the government of Honduras, dealt me the harshest punishment permissible under their secret contracts with the CIA. Knowing that I intended to eventually capitalize on my adventures in Bolivia, they rescinded any and all of my copyright, trademark, and other business privileges within their borders. No "Dr. Toast, The Bolivian Autobiography". No "Dr. Toast, the Honduran Movie". No "Dr. Toast, the Bolivian and Honduran Breakfast Cereal". This is the price we must pay for standing by our morals.

So the next time you hear someone say, "Bolivian toast comes from aliens," do not be overcome with despair. Just be inspired by the fact that Dr. Toast tried to do the right thing.

      <span class='entry-meta'>posted October 17, 1996</span>
      <p>Q: What do I do with burnt toast? Is burnt toast even still considered toast?

Blackened in Beantown (chacker@xxxxx.edu)
<!--more-->

A: Of course burnt toast is considered toast. I prefer to call it "carbon-enriched". We are, after all, carbon based life forms. All that distinguishes humankind from a slice of carbon-enriched toast is a central nervous system. And some amino acids and stuff.

As spiritually empowering and philosophically inspiring as carbon-enriched toast is, the simple fact remains that it is not tasty. Therefore, when one is confronted with a slice of toast that is edibly challenged, one must take immediate steps to undo the damage.

The easiest way to unburn a slice of toast is to simply reverse the direction of time itself. We know from Einstein's theory of general relativity (see Dr. Toast's explanation of the Coriolis effect and Einstein's theory as they pertain to toast), the faster an object travels, the slower it experiences time. At the speed of light, time would be at a standstill. Any faster, and time would reverse.

Unfortunately, Einstein's theory states that it is impossible for any object to reach the speed of light.

Well, Mr. Einstein, never underestimate the power of Toast.

All that is necessary to accelerate a slice of toast to the speed of light and beyond is a good hefty toss. Don't let its crusty texture deceive you, toast is actually the most aerodynamically perfect object in the universe. With a good windup and a well-timed flick of the wrist, it is possible to hurl a slice of toast with sufficient force that it actually rips a hole in the fabric of space-time, emerging as a tasty slice of bread ready for a second chance.

In fact, you may even have to take it out of the bag again.

      <span class='entry-meta'>posted October 17, 1996</span>
      <p>Q: I have a burning toast question. I hate it when you have a nice slice of yummy, yet untoasted, bread which is a little too thick or a little too long to fit into the slot of the toaster. Is there anything I can do to transform this piece of "virgin" toast into the crispy, steamy, crunchy, warm toast that it longs to be without chopping it up and being left with undesirable pieces of raw bread?

-- Befuddled in Boston (chacker@xxxxx.edu)
<!--more-->

A: Obviously, the solution to this dilemma lies not in foolishly attempting to make the bread smaller. Therefore, the only possible solution is to make the toaster larger.

"But", you ask, "how do I make my toaster larger?"

Several options are available. Select the one that best fits your emotional and philosophical needs.

1. Tape several slices of bread to the exterior of the toaster. Connect the appliance to the wall current and initiate a standard toasting cycle. The electrons will sense the overpowering karma of the bread through the cold steel of the toaster's walls. In fact, they will be so eager to reach the bread that they will pound and expand the walls of the toaster in their frantic quest for breakfast nirvana (see Dr. Toast's explanation of the "Electron Anxiety Effect".

2. Fill toaster with Mountain Dew. Cover slots with hands and shake vigorously. (Dr. Toast will not be held responsible for any internal appliance corrosion or personal health issues that may result)

3. Fuse the DNA of your toaster with the DNA of a larger appliance, such as a microwave. Your toaster will evolve into a larger, higher technology machine but may produce slightly soggy toast. Be prepared for other unpredictable effects as well (see Jeff Goldblum in the movie "The Fly"...)

4. A simple but inelegant method is to soak the toaster in tomato juice. Submerse the appliance in a bathtub filled with tepid tomato juice, and let sit for two to three hours until plump and wrinkled (Warning: Do not attempt to operate the toaster during this process). This method is also useful for the toaster which has been sprayed by a skunk.

5. Pray for a miracle at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.q7.com/~cramsay/shrine.html">Shrine to Toast</a>. Hey, it could happen.

      <span class='entry-meta'>posted June 15, 1996</span>
      <p>Q: Dr. Toast, my toaster has this extremely annoying habit of over-cooking one side of the toast and leaving the other side almost raw. I have tried just about everything to solve this problem, but nothing will work.

Can you help?

-- Kate (pseamer@xxxxx.au)
<!--more-->A: Kate, what you are experiencing is the unfortunate result of a combination of the Coriolis Effect and Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.

The Exploratorium gives the following definition of the generalized Coriolis Effect: "In a rotating environment, an object moves faster if it is farther from the axis of rotation (it moves in a bigger circle)." In other words, objects that are closer to the Earth's poles will move slower than objects that are closer to the equator.

Now, under Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, time, or space-time, cannot be measured absolutely: it is always relative to some other point of reference. In fact, an object traveling at a high velocity experiences time more slowly than an object traveling at a low velocity.

When the effects of Coriolis and Special Relativity are combined, toast is the ultimate victim. Most of us, for reasons too complicated to state here, are instinctively driven to orient our toasters parallel to the Earth's lines of latitude. Therefore, one side of the toast is closer to the equator, and one side is closer to the North or South Pole. Due to the Coriolis Effect, the Equator-Side of the toast is traveling at a higher velocity than the Pole-Side. And, due to the Special Theory of Relativity, the high-velocity Equator-Side is experiencing time more slowly than is the low-velocity Pole-Side.

You guessed it: the end result is that the Pole-Side actually spends more time in the toaster and becomes overdone, while the Equator-Side is undercooked.

Kate, I am currently researching ways to halt the spinning of the Earth in order to alleviate this problem for the citizens of the world. In the meantime, there are two simple ways for you to save your toast from the ravages of physics. You could rotate your toaster 180 degrees in the middle of the toasting process, or you could relocate yourself and your toaster to one of the Earth's poles.

      <p>Q: Dr. Toast, is there such a thing as having an addiction to toast? I can't seem to get through my day without eating a slice of warm toast in the morning, and this really scares me, Doc.  And if so, is there a support group out there that can help me?

-- Your Pal, Skippy "Crunchy" P.B. (egu25989@xxxxx.edu)
<!--more-->A: Skippy, I'm afraid the addiction to toast is an extremely real and frighteningly common phenomenon.

The sad truth of the matter, Skippy, is that we are ALL hopelessly, permanently, and incurably addicted to toast.  However, we should be thankful, for a healthy addiction to toast keeps us safe from the devastating effects of toast's only alternative: street drugs.

Unfortunately, it has come to my attention recently that many of America's young folks are in fact choosing these street drugs over toast.  This can be attributed directly to a lack of toast education.  So for all you kiddies reading this, I give you this Netscape-Enhanced table comparing toast and crack:

Say "NO" to Drugs!  Say "YES" to Toast!

P.S. -- Obviously, since we are all toast addicts, there are no formal toast support groups.  Just eat a slice and watch "Melrose Place" or something.

      <p>Q: Dr. Toast, your knowledge of the toaster astounds and amazes me. How did you come to learn so much about toast?

-- An Inquiring Mind (mango@xxxxx.edu)
<!--more-->A: This is a subject I find somewhat difficult to talk about, but because of its therapeutic value, I'll tell you, Inquiring Mind. In 1982, when I was in the second grade, I was struck in the head by a large piece of toasted sourdough bread traveling at a high velocity (presumably ejected from a toaster by Satan). The toast lodged just below my left frontal lobe, and I fell into a deep coma. Because of the precarious placement of the toast, the doctors were afraid to remove it for fear of causing further damage. My family and friends stood nearby, waiting for the inevitable. Little did they know, however, that all of the wisdom and power of generations of toast was slowly seeping into my young, absorbent mind. When I miraculously awoke three months later, the toast was gone, my head had healed, and I had become Dr. Toast. It was a traumatic experience for a second grader, but through the years my place in the world has become clear to me.

I Toast, Therefore I Am.

      <span class='entry-meta'>posted April 3, 1996</span>
      <p>Q: Dr. Toast, my toaster displays the alarming syndrome in which my toast is shot across the room, often to distances reaching up to 3 or 4 feet. If I am not present when this occurs, I have to waste my time hunting for the toast in some obscure corner of the room. This disturbs me. Is there anything that can be done?

-- Jennifer (j@xxxxx.com)
<!--more-->A: Jennifer, it's really quite simple. Your toaster has been possessed by Satan. While you should feel honored that the Prince of Darkness himself has chosen one of your household appliances as his earthly incarnation, the repercussions, in terms of toast, are not good. Obviously, a toaster is an extremely cramped living environment for someone who is accustomed to the spoils that go along with the position of Evil Overlord. So he does what any sensible Demon Master would do: Evict the Toast! And with a vengeance, apparently.

What you need to do, Jennifer, is convince the Vile Displacer of Toast that he has an overwhelming desire to upgrade to a more spacious appliance, preferably one that you don't use often, and preferably one in a somewhat secluded part of the house so you won't be too bothered by the incessant screams of tortured souls. The "Salad-Shooter" that most of us have tucked away in some dank corner of the kitchen would be a prime candidate, were it not for the size limitation. However, the "Salad-Shooter Professional Model" would be perfectly adequate.

      <span class='entry-meta'>posted April 2, 1996</span>
      <p>Q: Why does my toaster (and several others that I've encountered) have a designated slot for "One Slice Only"? Doesn't that exclude the other slot from its share of the toasting? What right does the manufacturer have to arbitrarily choose one side to have all the single toastings while the other side only gets a slice of bread as a leftover from the "One Slice" side's overabundance?

It just doesn't seem fair!

-- Alissa (mango@xxxxx.edu)
<!--more-->A: Well, I'll tell you, Alissa. It has to do with the "Electron Anxiety" effect. You see, electrons are extremely nervous little critters. They are quite comfortable while they are safely within the power lines that are suspended above our streets and run through the walls in our homes. However, once they enter a household appliance, major or minor, they become extremely nervous and, frankly, somewhat homesick. They experience an overwhelming desire to retreat to safety as quickly as possible. Unless, of course, there is a nice comforting slice of raw toast (a.k.a. "bread") nearby.

For economic reasons too complicated to state here, toasters are configured with the power cord entering the device on the side, closer to one slice than the other. When two slices of raw toast are present, the electrons, sensing the positive balanced karma radiating from the raw toast, are comfortable enough to roam freely throughout the appliance, generally distributing themselves evenly on both sides of the toaster. However, when only one slice of raw toast is present, half of the toaster becomes a barren environment that is extremely inhospitable to homesick electrons. If this raw-toast-less gap were on the side where the power cord enters, the electrons would enter the appliance from the end of the cord, witness the shocking void directly before them, and promptly retreat to the sanctity of the wiring in your kitchen, huddling and biding their time until they were called for the next potential toasting.

Therefore, the toaster manufacturers put the "One Slice Only" side nearest the power cord. The electrons enter the appliance and are greeted with a beautiful, welcoming slice of raw toast which they don't hesitate to surround and bathe with their toastifying magic.
