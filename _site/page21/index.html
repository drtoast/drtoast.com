      <span class='entry-meta'>posted April 11, 1997 | <a href="/departments/ask-dr-toast/">ask-dr-toast</a></span>
      <p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Does toasting bread reduce calories or carbohydrates?</p>

<p>&#8211; Joslin (rjoslin@xxxxx.com)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The process of toasting bread does not physically reduce calories or carbohydrates. However, eating toast will make you more popular and attractive.</p>

<p>You see, Joslin, toasting bread fundamentally changes its molecular structure. The high temperature convection currents within the toaster transform the complex carbohydrates, through a process known as &#8220;Toaster Induced Molecular Transfiguration&#8221;, or TIMT, into new molecules that are actually capable of altering the structure of your DNA. These new molecules are called &#8220;Molecular Toast Genetic Transmogrificators&#8221;, or MTGTs. When the MTGTs enter your bloodstream, they seek out the nuclei of your cells and, through the process of &#8220;Active Molecular Toast Genetic Transmogrification&#8221;, or AMTGT, modify the very sequence of your genetic code. The resulting enhanced genetic material is appropriately called &#8220;Toast Initiated Genetic Transmogrificant&#8221;, or TIGT, which over time will result in &#8220;Toast Accellerated Human Evolution&#8221;, or TAHE. So you see, TIMT-induced MTGTs result in AMTGT on your DNA, giving you TIGT leading to TAHE which, FYI, is A-OK.</p>

<p>Sound a little scary? Well, never fear. Because they are a miracle born of toast, the MTGTs only replace segments of your DNA which are directly detrimental to your looks and popularity. For example, if through some unfortunate twist of fate the encoding of your DNA has left you with the irresistable urge to dance the Macarena whenever you hear that ridiculous song, the MTGTs will overwrite that flawed section. The perverted impulse will be replaced with the overwhelming need to put on a classic Miles Davis record instead.</p>

<p>The principle is also true of physical flaws. No more bad hair days. No more stinky feet. And you know that little flap of skin you get when you burn the roof of your mouth with a really hot slice of pizza? If you eat enough toast, your repaired genes will give you a more heat-resistant, pizza-tolerant mouth.</p>

<p>So eat your toast, Joslin. For yourself, and for your posterity.</p>

      <p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Dr. Toast, I need help! I accidentally brought my toaster to life and now it is trying to kill me and my family with a can of Cheez Whiz! What do I do??!</p>

<p>&#8211; Mikey (Mikey6585@xxxxx.com)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Mikey, do not be alarmed at your toaster&#8217;s unprovoked aggression. This is completely normal. You see, a toaster that has been unexpectedly brought to life simply needs time to adjust to its new environment. Take it by its cord and gently lead it on a leisurely tour around your home. Let it explore one room at a time, at its own pace. Show it where its food and water are kept, and talk to it in calm, reassuring tones.</p>

<p>If you give your toaster the love and attention it needs, keep it fed and groomed, and bring it in for regular visits at a factory authorized service center, you will be rewarded with many years of loyal companionship, unconditional love, and fresh, crispy toast.</p>

      <p><p><strong>Q:</strong> My clone and I woke up this morning with a craving for french toast. We just happened to be online when we looked up &#8220;toast&#8221; hoping for&#8230; well, we didn&#8217;t really know what we were hoping for. Then we found you.</p>

<p>Anyway, our question is: how did you become a certified doctor of toast, and does it pay well?</p>

<p>&#8211; Olga and her clone (SonicEclps@xxxxx.com)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The two of you can read about my amazing transformation from a simple dullard into the spectacularly sagacious Dr. Toast in my reply to the letter from &#8221;<a href='http://www.drtoast.com/crumbs/11'>An Inquiring Mind</a>&#8221;.</p>

<p>And yes, the job pays well, but most of my income is squandered on the kickbacks I pay to the Bolivian military for covert shipments of extraterrestrial toast. Hey, we all have our weaknesses&#8230;</p>

      <p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are you not Dr. Toast in Bolivia? Is Dr. Toast trademarked there? Does your degree in all things toast not translate into Latin cultures? Do you ever wonder why a cold-fusion toaster would be a bad thing?</p>

<p>&#8211; Yours in toast, Katie (avatrice@xxxxx.net)</p>

<p>(ed. note: Katie is referring to the copyright disclaimer at the bottom of the page.)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Katie, your sharp eyes have uncovered another dark, obscure bit of Dr. Toast&#8217;s past, a past which haunts him even today in his copyright disclaimers.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1984, I was a ten-year-old child who had received the gift of amazing toast intellect just two years earlier. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the CIA learned of my powers, and one sweltering July day they did.</p>

<p>They caught up with me in a cafe in the North Beach district of San Francisco, where I was standing on the small black plywood stage, a young prophet preaching the word of toast to the disheveled masses gathered around me. Before anyone knew what was happening, men in dark glasses and sharp suits rushed in and hustled me off into a waiting van.</p>

<p>John Burton was the local CIA operative who filled me in as we drove towards the airport. Seems they needed my superhuman intellect to crush a powerful ring of government-sponsored toast smugglers working out of Bolivia, flying their goods out of the country in cargo planes provided by the Honduran military in exchange for a cut of the profits. &#8220;You can&#8217;t make me do jack,&#8221; I muttered as I snubbed my cigarette into the upholstery. &#8220;Is that so?&#8221; sneered Burton.</p>

<p>He reached into his raincoat and slowly withdrew a fresh loaf of Home-Pride brand buttertop wheat bread. He untwisted the twistie sadistically and, savoring the look of terror on my face, began tossing slices out of the van&#8217;s window, one by one. &#8220;Enough!&#8221; I cried. &#8221;I&#8217;ll do your dirtywork.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stepped off of the plane in the Bolivian capital of Sucre, in the Chuquisaca region. The air was so thick you almost needed gills and fins. It was hard to imagine a crispy slice of toast originating in such an inhospitable environment, but everyone knows this is where you buy the good stuff. Comes from climate-controlled warehouses deep in central Bolivia. A multi-billion-dollar industry.</p>

<p>As my Bolivian contact, Mario Villegas, drove our jeep along the muddy road to our destination, I opened the manilla envelope Burton had given me and started to read. The center of the operation was a fortified government lab deep in the rainforest between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz in central Bolivia. The local townspeople were virtual slave laborers for the government, sorting and packing the precious commodity. If they refused to work, the government cut the power to their homes, rendering their toasters useless. The very thought gives me chills to this day.</p>

<p>Soon after nightfall, Villegas stopped the jeep about two miles from the lab. We would make our final approach on foot under cover of darkness. &#8221;I&#8217;ve gotta quit smoking,&#8221; I wheezed as I hacked through the vines with my machete. &#8220;Here, have a slice of toast,&#8221; Villegas offered. Not surprisingly, it was the good stuff. My stamina restored, we pressed onwards.</p>

<p>We were close. The glimmer of floodlamps began to flash through the swaying foliage from time to time. When we finally came to the chain-link and razorwire fence at the perimeter of the compound, Villegas was as shocked as I. &#8220;The ruins of an ancient Tiahuanacan temple? So far from Lake Titicaca?&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;It seems our government has many secrets,&#8221; mumbled Villegas.</p>

<p>Military vehicles were lined up by the edges of the temple, not far from a large circular area which was inscribed with strange ancient characters, pointing inwards. The large character at the center looked somehow familiar: a square with a bulging, uneven top. Couldn&#8217;t quite place it. The circular area was brightly illuminated with floodlamps, and men in fatigues lounged by the vehicles. &#8220;It looks like they&#8217;re waiting for something,&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>As I tried to light another cigarette, a sudden breeze hindered my efforts. The breeze grew, and soon a low whirring noise became noticeable. As colored light began to bathe the entire area, Villegas and I slowly tilted our heads back, only to be practically blinded by the phantasmagorical display that was descending from the heavens.</p>

<p>The lights swirled and danced on the temple and forest as the enormous spacecraft approached the landing area. After the soft thud of contact, a door quietly slid open.</p>

<p>The smell of toast was overwhelming.</p>

<p>Dozens of small, spindly creatures formed a line going from the craft along the ramp to the ground and, fire-brigade style, began passing along slices of hot, crisp toast and placing it in neat symmetrical stacks on the tarmac. The eyes of the military men glittered with greed as they watched the slowly accumulating bounty.</p>

<p>Immediately, my hyper-intelligent toast intellect put two and two together. I grabbed Villegas&#8217; shoulder. &#8220;Do you realize what&#8217;s happening here?&#8221; I trembled as rage swelled up within me. &#8220;These extraterrestrials were the benefactors of the ancient Tiahuanacan people. Lacking electricity, the Tiahuanacans had no way to make toast. It was a dire need that was generously filled by the technologically advanced aliens, but now the well-meaning creatures are unaware that the Tiahuanacan civilization disappeared eight hundred years ago! They continue their timely deliveries of toast, which are snapped up by these money-grubbing fiends!&#8221;</p>

<p>I could contain myself no longer. I had to end this charade. Before Villegas could stop me, I scrambled clumsily over the razor wire and made a dash for the landing area. &#8220;Benevolent creatures! Your generosity is being wasted!&#8221; I yelled as I ran. &#8220;The Tiahuanacans are &#8211; &#8221; Two large men in fatigues cut the thought short as they threw me down and pinned me by my bloodied arms, knocking me breathless. The aliens, startled by the commotion, hastily left in a swirling vortex of dust and light. In retrospect, they probably didn&#8217;t speak English, anyway.</p>

<p>One of the men produced a .45 which he placed to my head. His partner stopped him, pointing to the name tag I was fortunately wearing. &#8220;Hello, My Name Is: Dr. Toast, CIA&#8221;. They knew the CIA signed their paychecks for a number of covert operations, and that to dispose of Dr. Toast would be a bad career move.</p>

<p>After my release, the Bolivian government, in cooperation with the government of Honduras, dealt me the harshest punishment permissible under their secret contracts with the CIA. Knowing that I intended to eventually capitalize on my adventures in Bolivia, they rescinded any and all of my copyright, trademark, and other business privileges within their borders. No &#8220;Dr. Toast, The Bolivian Autobiography&#8221;. No &#8220;Dr. Toast, the Honduran Movie&#8221;. No &#8220;Dr. Toast, the Bolivian and Honduran Breakfast Cereal&#8221;. This is the price we must pay for standing by our morals.</p>

<p>So the next time you hear someone say, &#8220;Bolivian toast comes from aliens,&#8221; do not be overcome with despair. Just be inspired by the fact that Dr. Toast tried to do the right thing.</p>

<p>&#8211; Dr. Toast</p>

<p>ps - About the cold fusion toaster: It&#8217;s a good idea, but it makes the toast taste funny.</p></p>

      <span class='entry-meta'>posted October 17, 1996 | <a href="/departments/ask-dr-toast/">ask-dr-toast</a></span>
      <p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What do I do with burnt toast? Is burnt toast even still considered toast?</p>

<p>Blackened in Beantown (chacker@xxxxx.edu)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Of course burnt toast is considered toast. I prefer to call it &#8220;carbon-enriched&#8221;. We are, after all, carbon based life forms. All that distinguishes humankind from a slice of carbon-enriched toast is a central nervous system. And some amino acids and stuff.</p>

<p>As spiritually empowering and philosophically inspiring as carbon-enriched toast is, the simple fact remains that it is not tasty. Therefore, when one is confronted with a slice of toast that is edibly challenged, one must take immediate steps to undo the damage.</p>

<p>The easiest way to unburn a slice of toast is to simply reverse the direction of time itself. We know from Einstein&#8217;s theory of general relativity (see Dr. Toast&#8217;s explanation of the Coriolis effect and Einstein&#8217;s theory as they pertain to toast), the faster an object travels, the slower it experiences time. At the speed of light, time would be at a standstill. Any faster, and time would reverse.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Einstein&#8217;s theory states that it is impossible for any object to reach the speed of light.</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Einstein, never underestimate the power of Toast.</p>

<p>All that is necessary to accelerate a slice of toast to the speed of light and beyond is a good hefty toss. Don&#8217;t let its crusty texture deceive you, toast is actually the most aerodynamically perfect object in the universe. With a good windup and a well-timed flick of the wrist, it is possible to hurl a slice of toast with sufficient force that it actually rips a hole in the fabric of space-time, emerging as a tasty slice of bread ready for a second chance.</p>

<p>In fact, you may even have to take it out of the bag again.</p>

      <span class='entry-meta'>posted October 17, 1996 | <a href="/departments/ask-dr-toast/">ask-dr-toast</a></span>
      <p><p><strong>Q:</strong> I have a burning toast question. I hate it when you have a nice slice of yummy, yet untoasted, bread which is a little too thick or a little too long to fit into the slot of the toaster. Is there anything I can do to transform this piece of &#8220;virgin&#8221; toast into the crispy, steamy, crunchy, warm toast that it longs to be without chopping it up and being left with undesirable pieces of raw bread?</p>

<p>&#8211; Befuddled in Boston (chacker@xxxxx.edu)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Obviously, the solution to this dilemma lies not in foolishly attempting to make the bread smaller. Therefore, the only possible solution is to make the toaster larger.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&#8221;, you ask, &#8220;how do I make my toaster larger?&#8221;</p>

<p>Several options are available. Select the one that best fits your emotional and philosophical needs.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Tape several slices of bread to the exterior of the toaster. Connect the appliance to the wall current and initiate a standard toasting cycle. The electrons will sense the overpowering karma of the bread through the cold steel of the toaster&#8217;s walls. In fact, they will be so eager to reach the bread that they will pound and expand the walls of the toaster in their frantic quest for breakfast nirvana (see Dr. Toast&#8217;s explanation of the &#8220;Electron Anxiety Effect&#8221;.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fill toaster with Mountain Dew. Cover slots with hands and shake vigorously. (Dr. Toast will not be held responsible for any internal appliance corrosion or personal health issues that may result)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fuse the DNA of your toaster with the DNA of a larger appliance, such as a microwave. Your toaster will evolve into a larger, higher technology machine but may produce slightly soggy toast. Be prepared for other unpredictable effects as well (see Jeff Goldblum in the movie &#8220;The Fly&#8221;&#8230;)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A simple but inelegant method is to soak the toaster in tomato juice. Submerse the appliance in a bathtub filled with tepid tomato juice, and let sit for two to three hours until plump and wrinkled (Warning: Do not attempt to operate the toaster during this process). This method is also useful for the toaster which has been sprayed by a skunk.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Pray for a miracle at the <a href='http://www.q7.com/~cramsay/shrine.html'>Shrine to Toast</a>. Hey, it could happen.</p>

      <span class='entry-meta'>posted June 15, 1996 | <a href="/departments/ask-dr-toast/">ask-dr-toast</a></span>
      <p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Dr. Toast, my toaster has this extremely annoying habit of over-cooking one side of the toast and leaving the other side almost raw. I have tried just about everything to solve this problem, but nothing will work.</p>

<p>Can you help?</p>

<p>&#8211; Kate (pseamer@xxxxx.au)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Kate, what you are experiencing is the unfortunate result of a combination of the Coriolis Effect and Einstein&#8217;s Special Theory of Relativity.</p>

<p>The Exploratorium gives the following definition of the generalized Coriolis Effect: &#8220;In a rotating environment, an object moves faster if it is farther from the axis of rotation (it moves in a bigger circle).&#8221; In other words, objects that are closer to the Earth&#8217;s poles will move slower than objects that are closer to the equator.</p>

<p>Now, under Einstein&#8217;s Special Theory of Relativity, time, or space-time, cannot be measured absolutely: it is always relative to some other point of reference. In fact, an object traveling at a high velocity experiences time more slowly than an object traveling at a low velocity.</p>

<p>When the effects of Coriolis and Special Relativity are combined, toast is the ultimate victim. Most of us, for reasons too complicated to state here, are instinctively driven to orient our toasters parallel to the Earth&#8217;s lines of latitude. Therefore, one side of the toast is closer to the equator, and one side is closer to the North or South Pole. Due to the Coriolis Effect, the Equator-Side of the toast is traveling at a higher velocity than the Pole-Side. And, due to the Special Theory of Relativity, the high-velocity Equator-Side is experiencing time more slowly than is the low-velocity Pole-Side.</p>

<p>You guessed it: the end result is that the Pole-Side actually spends more time in the toaster and becomes overdone, while the Equator-Side is undercooked.</p>

<p>Kate, I am currently researching ways to halt the spinning of the Earth in order to alleviate this problem for the citizens of the world. In the meantime, there are two simple ways for you to save your toast from the ravages of physics. You could rotate your toaster 180 degrees in the middle of the toasting process, or you could relocate yourself and your toaster to one of the Earth&#8217;s poles.</p>

      <p><p><strong>Q:</strong> I have no questions to ask of your high intellect, as I have seen the light, and I live in the perpetual glow of toast. You may know me as the High Priest of Buttermilk Wheat, guardian of <a href='http://www.teleport.com/~cramsay/shrine.html'>The Shrine to Toast</a>. My busy schedule of preaching the Word to the masses has kept me from doing research on virtual toast, so this is the first time I have stumbled upon your words of wisdom. I enjoyed your page very much and you will recieve an honorable mention on my page of links which I will be updating this weekend.</p>

<p>Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>&#8211; Celeste (cramsay@xxxxx.com)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Celeste, I am truly honored that Her Toastiness would bestow such words on so humble a purveyor of savoir-toast as myself. While I specialize in the intellectual and philosophical aspects of toast, the spirituality of toast is undeniably of utmost importance to an individual&#8217;s inner harmony. Therefore, I encourage my readers to visit The Shrine often, and read the Words therein so that they too might be enlightened.</p>
