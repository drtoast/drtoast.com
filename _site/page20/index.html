      <h3 class='entry-title'><a href="/2005/08/10/dr-toasts-history-of-the-toaster">Dr. Toast's History of the Toaster</a></h3>
      <span class='entry-meta'>posted August 10, 2005 | <a href="/departments/toast-articles/">toast-articles</a></span>
      <p><p>by Dr. Toast</p>

<p>The Toaster was invented in 1491 by an obscure French alchemist by the name of GÃ©rard Depardieu (no relation to the actor). The invention was actually a lucky mistake - Depardieu had been trying to invent a machine that would take ordinary slices of bread and transform them into gold bullion.</p>

<p>Depardieu was not a particularly good alchemist. Through the unlikely discovery of several obscure and unrelated physical laws, all of his previous efforts had only succeeded in turning bread into either banana tapioca pudding or little snowflake-shaped doilies.</p>

<p>However, his patron, the King of France, was not fond of banana tapioca pudding or little snowflake-shaped doilies. In fact, he quite despised them, and told Depardieu that if he didn&#8217;t invent a machine capable of turning bread into gold within a fortnight, he would be beheaded. Depardieu, that is, not the King.</p>

<p>Having found this new source of inspiration, Depardieu returned to his efforts with fresh enthusiasm. He eventually struck upon the idea of creating a device that would harness yet another obscure physical law, which incidentally also required the invention of electricity, but we won&#8217;t get into that here.</p>

<p>Finally came the day for Depardieu to present his invention before the King&#8217;s court. Forged from the finest silver and delicately engraved with the King&#8217;s coat of arms, the device&#8217;s gracefully arched top featured two slender rectangular openings for the insertion of bread, and a long, gracefully trailing cord that plugged into the new electrical outlet behind the battle axe display case. The cord, incidentally, also required the invention of plastic, but we won&#8217;t get into that here.</p>

<p>Depardieu had never before tested this new device, as he had an irrational fear of failure and always preferred to postpone it for as long as possible. So, with great caution and trepidation, with the King and all his court eyeing him leerily, Depardieu inserted the bread into the machine and pushed its lever down.</p>

<p>An anxious silence settled upon the room, permeated only slightly by the faint hum coming from the machine. Soon thereafter began to arise a heavenly scent like none had ever before experienced. The King sat forward, his eyes bulging greedily &#8211; for certainly, this must be the smell of gold!</p>

<p>But what eventually emerged from the toaster looked quite unlike gold. In fact, it looked quite similar to the bread that had originally gone into the device, only slightly darker and crispier.</p>

<p>Depardieu knew this meant trouble. As he silently pondered his impending doom, he absentmindedly withdrew the toaster&#8217;s offering and took a nibble.</p>

<p>His eyes suddenly widened and did several things in an apparent attempt to escape his head. Then in his developing shock, he stumbled backwards a bit, then forwards, then backwards again, much like someone being forced to dance the cha-cha immediately after hearing that they were descended from an elm tree and a wedge of exotic cheese. His flustered hands tried to do several unrelated things at once, all of which precluded any kind of holding of toast, which he caught just before it was able to teeter to the stone floor. He steadied himself, seized the other unsuspecting slice from the machine, and dashed forward with it to the King&#8217;s throne.</p>

<p>After his first taste, the King knew that Depardieu&#8217;s discovery was worth more than any amount of gold, that it would forever make France the most powerful nation in the land, and that he should name it after his eldest and most beautiful daughter, Toast. While history has unfortunately proven him a bit less than accurate on point number two, the first and third were very keen insight indeed.</p>

<p>The year after the Toaster&#8217;s invention, a number of units were installed on the three ships that Christopher Columbus took on his expedition across the Atlantic to the New World. Unfortunately, after the first week of the long journey, all the bread was used up, and the crew had to survive on toasted fish for seven months. The explorers gradually forgot what toast was really supposed to taste like, and eventually decided that toast was an altogether unpleasant and generally rank thing to eat. It is therefore not surprising that it rapidly fell out of favor and was forgotten for four hundred years, until the toaster&#8217;s eventual re-invention in 1909 by Charles Strite.</p>

<p>So the next time you sit down to relax with a nice hot slice of that heavenly breakfast treat, take a moment to pause and say, &#8220;Thanks, GÃ©rard Depardieu.&#8221;</p>

      <span class='entry-meta'>posted April 17, 2001 | <a href="/departments/ask-dr-toast/">ask-dr-toast</a></span>
      <p><p><strong>Q:</strong> okay, do note my email address. it&#8217;s true. i hate toast. i think it&#8217;s a crunchy to soft bread ratio issue. croutons are the worst for me. i just want you to know that i have received this web site from many of my students who think my issues with toast are nuts.</p>

<p>you are quite the site for about 100 4th and 5th graders now.</p>

<p>i&#8217;ve bookmarked it, because i might not like the stuff, but i love information. it&#8217;s a great site!</p>

<p>&#8211; kt (ihatetoast@xxxxx.com)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Dear Katy, thanks for your note. I am sorry to hear we have such differing opinions on the subject of toast. However, if you&#8217;ll just hear me out for a moment:</p>

<p>Perhaps you hate toast simply because you&#8217;ve never had really GOOD toast. For example, if you have toast made with dense and dry bread, lacking fresh, properly proportioned toppings, the experience will no doubt be less than satisfying, and could in fact be psychologically damaging.</p>

<p>However, toast doesn&#8217;t have to be dry and boring. There are a large number of recipes on my site showing what you can do with a slice of toast, a creative mind, and way too much time on your hands. Yet it doesn&#8217;t even need to be that creative: one of my favorites is a single slice of lightly toasted oat bread, topped with a little butter and drizzled with fresh honey. A delicious snack that&#8217;s lower in calories than many other treats, such as TWO pieces of toast topped with a little butter and drizzled with fresh honey.</p>

<p>Of course, you don&#8217;t have to even eat toast to realize its glory. For example, many people find toast to be an inspiring metaphor for the American Dream, or discover that it is a reliable friend and confidant, or even just a sort of muse for general creative inspiration.</p>

<p>Or maybe you just don&#8217;t like toast because it doesn&#8217;t like you. But no need to take it personally - I once got into quite a fight with a bowl of stir fried bok choy that started saying unspeakable things about my mother. These things happen.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even though you do not like toast, I don&#8217;t hold it against you. We are all entitled to our own opinions, no matter how wrong they may be.</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>&#8211; Dr. Toast</p></p>

      <span class='entry-meta'>posted November 17, 1998 | <a href="/departments/ask-dr-toast/">ask-dr-toast</a></span>
      <p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Please tell me why my raisins that fall into the bottom of the toaster catch on fire.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>&#8211; Pam (UpstatePam@xxxxx.com)</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Pam, contrary to popular belief, raisins do not &#8220;fall&#8221; into the bottom of the toaster. The unpleasant truth of the matter is that they jump.</p>

<p>With crazed resolve, they willfully meet their fiery demise to dramatically demonstrate their outrage at the social injustices that take place on a daily basis within a slice of toast. You see, a slice of toast is actually an extremely complex socio-economic environment, complete with a hierarchical social system, political corruption, private monopolies, budget deficits, inflation, and unemployment. Bread has many diverse ingredients working with each other and against each other, forming coalitions and rivalries - a chaotic system that inevitably swings periodically to either end of the political spectrum. Indeed, a slice of toast is not unlike modern American society.</p>

<p>A number of recent events are responsible for particularly heating up (no pun intended) the current social climate of toast. In one well-publicized incident that was captured on videotape, an innocent raisin was driving through a mostly wheat neighborhood, when police stopped him and beat him senseless. (Granted, he was already a raisin so he didn&#8217;t look too different afterwards.) Outraged raisins throughout the entire slice rioted, leaving a charred hulk of a once-proud slice.</p>

<p>In an unrelated incident, violence broke out in a slice of Oat Nut bread. Some Quakers were minding their own business when the local skinhead Almonds began taunting them. The Quakers were steamed, and the Almonds eventually went nuts, beating the Quakers to a pulp. When the dust settled, all that remained was a rather tasty porridge.</p>

<p>So to make a long story short, raisins have always been the most politically active of the ingredients in a slice of toast. They feel they have exhausted all other options for bringing about social change in their particular slice of the world, so they illustrate their passion by throwing themselves to the fate that awaits them in the dark and crumby recesses at the bottom of the toaster.</p>

<p>Hmmm, on a second reading it looks like your question is actually why do they catch fire, not why do they fall. Well, I would guess that&#8217;s because toasters are very, very hot.</p>
