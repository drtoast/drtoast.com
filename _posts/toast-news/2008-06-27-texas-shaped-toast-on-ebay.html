<p><a href="http://www.amyleblanc.com/" title="Intellectual Properties" target="_blank">Amy</a> pointed me to this item on <a href="http://valleywag.com/378510/startup-employee-retirement-plan-sell-toast-on-ebay" title="Valleywag" target="_blank">Valleywag</a>: "A friend of an animator laid off from a recently imploded East Bay videogames startup writes to pimp the newly unemployed buddy's latest venture: selling toast on eBay. But not just any toast â€” it's toast that will be lovingly sculpted into the shape of each of America's 50 great states. First up? <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=190213572246" title="Texas Toast on eBay" target="_blank">Texas</a>. You laugh now, but you won't think it's such a terrible idea when the recession has you out on the street and your options underwater."</p>
