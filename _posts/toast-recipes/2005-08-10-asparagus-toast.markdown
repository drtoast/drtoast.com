White Sauce for Asparagus:

* asparagus
* 1/4 cup butter
* 2 Tbsp. chopped onion 
* 2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
* 1/4 cup flour
* 1 cup milk
* 1 cup light sour cream
* Toast

Steam asparagus in microwave or steamer. Melt butter in non-stick skillet and add chopped onion. Saute it a bit. Add sliced fresh mushrooms. In a separate container, mix flour and milk until there are no lumps. Place in skillet to thicken. Add light sour cream and heat through. Place steamed asparagus on toast and pour sauce on top. Sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top, if desired.
