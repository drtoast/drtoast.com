You can use any kind of mushrooms for this or a combination of your favorite kinds. I use simple button mushrooms.

* Wash and dry 1½ pounds of mushrooms. Slice thinly.

Mix sliced mushrooms with: 

* 4 Tablespoons olive oil 
* 4 Tablespoons chopped parsley 
* 2 to 4 minced garlic cloves. 
* Salt and pepper to taste. 
* Set aside.

Melt 2 ½ Tablespoons butter in a skillet until sizzling. 

Add mushrooms to butter and sauté five to eight minutes. Stir constantly and sauté until the mushrooms are just beginning to release water. 

Add: 

* 2 to 3 Tablespoons lemon juice 
* 1 Tablespoon apple cider vinegar 
* 2 Tablespoons chopped cilantro

Cook over high heat for about five minutes, stirring constantly.

Mound over toast and dribble pan juices over the top.

Garnish with a dash of chili powder or ground black pepper.

Serve immediately.
