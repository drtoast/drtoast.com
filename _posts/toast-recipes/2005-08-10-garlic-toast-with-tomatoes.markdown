*from Malin*

* one baguette cut into 1/2-inch slices
* olive oil
* fresh herbs to your liking (basil, thyme, oregano, and cilantro work great)
* 1-3 garlic cloves 
* 4 or 5 cups diced tomatoes
* 2 or 3 cups diced onions
* for extra spice, one jalapeno, finely chopped
* salt and pepper

Drizzle olive oil on a cookie sheet, and rub the baguette slices on both sides. Peel garlic clove(s) and rub each slice with the garlic. Then set on cookie sheet and bake until golden brown and crispy (about 10 minutes). Combine remainder of ingredients in a bowl. Mix well. Scoop tomato mixture onto each toast slice, drizzle with a few more splashes of olive oil, and voila. You're good to go.
