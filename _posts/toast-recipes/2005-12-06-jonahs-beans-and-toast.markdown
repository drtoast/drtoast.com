Jonah's Beans and Toast

Serves 4

*by Jesse Ziff Cool from "Toast - 60 Ways to Butter Your Bread &amp; Then
Some"*

* 2 cans (each 16 ounces) baked beans with juices, or 4 cups cooked beans, cooking liquid reserved
* 2 tablespoons grated yellow onion
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
* Â½ cup ketchup
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 4 eggs
* 8 bread slices 
* Hot sauce for serving (optional)

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the beans and their juices, onion, thyme, and 1/4 cup of the ketchup and simmer for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium skilled, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Crack the eggs into the pan, cover, and cook for about 4 minutes for medium-cooked yolks. Toast the bread and spread the remaining 2 tablespoons butter on the slices. Place 2 slices, buttered-side up and overlapping slightly, on each of the 4 plates. Using a spatula, transfer 1 egg onto each of the 2 slices of toast. Spoon the beans over the eggs and toast. Top with the remaining 1/4 cup ketchup, dividing evenly. Pass hot sauce at the table, if using.
