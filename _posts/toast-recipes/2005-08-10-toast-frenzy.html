ingredient:

toast

PUT TOAST IN YOUR MOUTH AND EAT IT AND THEN GET REALLY HAPPY AND WATCH SOME TV AND JUMP AROUND AND THEN GO IN A CIRCLE JUMPING AND THEN SIT DOWN AND THEN GO AROUND AGAIN AND THEN EAT SOME TOAST AND THEN JUMP MORE AND THEN BE ALL LIKE "NO TOAST!" AND THEN BE ALL LIKE "YES TOAST!" AND EAT SOME TOAST AND JUMP AROUND AND SMASH YOUR TOASTER.
