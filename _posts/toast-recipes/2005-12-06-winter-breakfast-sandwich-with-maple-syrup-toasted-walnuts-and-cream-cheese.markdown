Winter Breakfast Sandwich with Maple Syrup, Toasted Walnuts, and Cream Cheese

Serves 4 to 6

*by Jesse Ziff Cool from "Toast - 60 Ways to Butter Your Bread & Then
Some"*

* 2/3 cup (about 3 ounces) coarsely chopped walnuts
* 8 ounces cream cheese at room temperature
* 3 tablespoons real maple syrup, plus more for garnishing
* ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
* Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
* ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
* 8 bread slices

Preheat the toaster oven to 350 degrees F. Put the walnuts on a baking tray and toast for 5 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, the 3 tablespoons maple syrup, the cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla and stir to blend. Toast the bread. Spread one-fourth of the cream cheese mixture on each of 4 slices and sprinkle with the walnuts. Drizzle with a little maple syrup. Top each with a slice of plain toast. Cut each into 2, 4, or even 6 pieces (for tiny bite-sized tea sandwiches).
