Mmmmmm.  Tonga Toast, otherwise known as the Polynesian's Banana-Stuffed French Toast, is the best meal served at Walt Disney World (in my humble opinion, of course).  Try this recipe at home.  It's never quite the same for me, though.  Maybe I need some fake Polynesian atmosphere, bird sounds, and a tropical lobby outside to make it complete.

* 2 or 4 slices sourdough bread, cut 1-inch thick
* 1 banana
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 egg
* 1/4 cup milk
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Oil or shortening for frying
* Whipped butter, if desired
* Maple syrup, if desired 

Depending on the size of the bread slices, cut a 1-inch pocket in one side of each bread slice.  Cut bananas in half crosswise, then split each piece lengthwise.  Remove peel and stuff 2 pieces in each pocket of bread, again depending on size.  If slices are small, use 4 and stuff 1 piece of banana in each pocket.  Set aside.
Mix sugar and cinnamon.  Set aside.

Mix egg, milk, and vanilla until well blended.

Heat about 4 inches of oil or shortening in a pan to 350 degrees F.  Dip stuffed bread into egg and milk mixture, soaking a few minutes to penetrate into bread.  Fry in hot oil or shortening until lightly browned, turning to brown both sides, about 3 minutes.  Drain on paper towels on cake rack.

Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon and serve at once.  If desired, spread with whipped butter and serve with Maple syrup.

Yield: 2 servings
