I've got another recipe for you. This one comes from "Mrs. Beaton's Book of Household Management", which dates from sometime in the 19th century, I think.

---- Begin ----

Toast Sandwich

Ingredients:

2 thick slices soft white bread
1 thin slice slightly stale bread
salt and pepper

Method:

Toast the thin slice to an even golden brown on both sides. Place it between the two thick slices and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serves 1.

---- End ----

Bizarrely, this actually tastes pretty good.
