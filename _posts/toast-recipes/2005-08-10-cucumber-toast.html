From "The Thorough Good Cook" by George Augustus Sala, 1896

Cucumber
3 egg yolks
1 beaten egg
Bread Crumbs

Make a ragout of cucumbers well thickened ; add to it the yolks of three eggs, dress them upon crumbs of bread, draw over the whole a knife dipped in a beaten egg; cover with grated bread and then fry.
