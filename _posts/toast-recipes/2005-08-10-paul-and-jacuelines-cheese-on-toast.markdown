* Bread
* Cheddar Cheese
* Tomato Puree
* Dried Mixed Herbs
* Olives

Toast bread on one side. Turn over and put a swirl of tomato puree on each slice. Cover with slices of cheese, sprinkle with dried herbs and place a few olives on each slice. Be careful the olives don't roll off!

Grill until the cheese bubbles. Eat.
