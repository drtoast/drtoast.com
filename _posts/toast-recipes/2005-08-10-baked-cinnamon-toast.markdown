Working with 1 strip of bread at a time, turn strips quickly in butter, coating them on all sides, letting any excess drip off, then turn them quickly in cinnamon-sugar, coating them on all sides. Bake strips in lightly buttered jellyroll pan in upper third of a preheated 375 degree oven for 10 minutes. Turn and bake 10 more minutes. Transfer with tongs to serving plate. Makes 24 pieces.
