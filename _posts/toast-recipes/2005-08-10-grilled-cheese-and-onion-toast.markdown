* finely chopped onion
* grated cheddar cheese

Prepare finely chopped onion and grated cheddar cheese. Lightly toast four slices (nos optional) in the small oven. Sprinkle the grated cheese and the finely chopped onion on the toast and place it in a small oven until the cheese melts with the browning of the onion.
