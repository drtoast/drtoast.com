I was just trying out <a href="http://booshaka.com">booshaka.com</a>, a search engine for Facebook, and typed in the words "Dr." and "Toast".  While my vanity search didn't pan out, I did discover that lots of kids like to serve their moms breakfast in bed with toast and Dr. Pepper.

<strong>Martha:</strong> "Awesome breakfast made by my awesome son for mothers day! Eggs, bacon, pancakes, toast and dt dr pepper! Ah i love my kids!"

<strong>Laverna:</strong> "Mother's Day memories of a small boy and girl proudly serving Mother breakast in bed. Rubbery eggs, toast with the burned part scraped off, a weiner split and cooked, flowers from the yard and a Dr. Pepper wrapped in foil...a priceless gift that can never be equaled and will never be forgotten. Thank you David and Darla. What a privilege it is to be your Mother."
