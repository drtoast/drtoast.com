<p>This Thursday, April 24th, 2008: Two DJs, one bus, one mobile soundsystem, cake, champagne! From Alxndr: "It's hard to believe we launched this mobile adventure called <a href="http://transportedsf.com" target="_blank">Transported</a> a year ago now. We do appreciate the support and your willingness to try new things. And we're very excited to ask you to join us for our birthday party! We've asked a couple old friends to help us celebrate this Thursday: Dr. Toast &amp; Piotron. We'll be supplying plenty of champagne and birthday cake so don't miss out. Note that we will NO LONGER be meeting at The Rite Spot. We are meeting at <a href="http://www.shinesf.com/" target="_blank">Shine</a> for check-in at 7:30pm and our bus leaves at 8pm. We will return you there at 11:30pm."</p>
<p>Tickets are $20 and can be purchased here:<a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/33896" target="_blank"></a></p>
