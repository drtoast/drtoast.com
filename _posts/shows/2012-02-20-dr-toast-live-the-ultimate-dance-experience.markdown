From [masstransitdance.com][info]: "Do you ever wish you could hear amazing music and have room to actually dance? Born from a frustration with the 'standard' music scene, Mass Transit Dance created 'The Ultimate Dance Experience', bringing you the best Producers and DJs in a space where you have room to DANCE in an alcohol-free, barefoot dance space with other conscious movers. To ensure ample room for moving, ticket sales are limited to 300 in the 12,000 square foot Historic Sweet's Ballroom in Oakland. Complimentary sacred tea service will be provided by Om Shan Tea."
