<span class="postbody">I'm going to be opening for Zepparella, an all-female Led Zeppelin
tribute band, at Slim's on Saturday the 22nd.</span>

The band is also launching a new project that night,
House of More, featuring their own original material.

How well will live laptop psychedelic downtempo go over with a
crowd that's pumped to hear ladies play Zeppelin?  Who knows?

Let's find out together!
