**Saturday, July 06, 2013, 6:00am** - Once again, False Profit will hold the annual Priceless camp-out in early July. Join us in celebration with our unique brand of art, activities, and music for our eighth (omg) year in a row throwing down on the Feather River. Dr. Toast plays at Sunrise at the main stage on Saturday morning, and with Ganucheau as our "Bookends" collaboration at the Forest stage (time TBD).
