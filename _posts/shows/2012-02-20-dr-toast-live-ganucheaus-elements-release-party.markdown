**Saturday, February 25, 2012, 10pm-2am** - My good friend and musical collaborator [Ganucheau][] is releasing his beautiful, long-anticipated album "[Elements][]" on [False Profit Records][fpr], and I have the honor of performing at the album release party. Also playing are Ganucheau (of course), [Evolutionista][] and [Palindrome][]. $5 cover, or $10 including a code for digital download. Underground location will be announced on the day of the event.
