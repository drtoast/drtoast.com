<p>My thanks to Melvin Priester for hosting this listening party for my new music! Melvin says:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">"A good number of my favorite Burning Man stories now start like this, 'I was hanging out in our dome and then Dr. Toast started playing...' Simply put, lying on fuzzy gymmats, listening to Dr. Toast play live, watching cool visuals on a tricked out system is one of my favorite things in the world. So, in celebration of Dr. Toast's forthcoming new CD, The Wave Function, and also my impending departure for Europe and South America (leaving SF for A WHILE March 12), we will be recreating that set-up, sans dust, on March 6 from 8:30 to 11 p.m. @ the amazing loft of the man who has provided both the cush and the sound behind so many of my favorite burning man experiences."</span></p>
