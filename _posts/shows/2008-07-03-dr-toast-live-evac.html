<p>Saturday, July 5th, 2008 - <a href="http://false-profit.com/" target="_blank">False Profit, LLC</a>'s annual Life Quality Enhancement product, <a href="http://priceless.false-profit.com/" target="_blank">Priceless</a>, was scheduled for release in Belden this coming weekend but has been recalled due to uncontained pre-apocalyptic wildfire. Insiders at the company are reporting that Priceless is now set for release later this summer. In response, False Profit's Research and Development Brigade worked frantically for two days to develop a replacement product. False Profitâ€™s first response to the statewide catastrophe, called <a href="http://www.false-profit.com/2008/07/05/evac/" target="_blank">EVAC!</a>, is set to be unveiled at a warehouse location in San Francisco on Saturday, July 5th, 2008.</p>
