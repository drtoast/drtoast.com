October 20, 2007 - "Word of Mouth" are a great bunch of folks who throw free events promoted primarily by... well, word of mouth!  Join us for music and dancing at a two-part party, first from noon to 6 at a park in Oakland, then from 6pm until late at an intimate warehouse location in Alameda.  Dr. Toast performs at around 7:30 during the open bar... See the <a href="http://www.womsound.com/womsf/" title="Word of Mouth" target="_blank">WOM</a> website for details!
