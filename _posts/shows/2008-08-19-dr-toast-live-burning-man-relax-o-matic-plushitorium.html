<p>Wednesday, August 27, 2008 @ 6pm-ish: The camp with the unwieldy yet oh-so-apt name is hosting a <strong>toast-themed happy hour</strong>, and yours truly is providing the soundtrack! William tells me, "I have created a screen print of toast popping out of a toaster which we will apply onto peoples clothes, we will serve toast, give toasts and offer treats toasted in various ways." And Marty says, "We're in the midst of preparations and and we're all really psyched for the Wednesday happy hour. We've already starting spreading the word and we're thinking about starting your set around dusk, or maybe even a little earlier -- like somewhere in the 6pm - 9pm time frame. You can spin for however long you want, and then there will probably be another DJ coming on. We'll wrap things up and roll out into the night around 11 or 12. I don't really ever wear a watch out there so these are all rough time estimates."</p>
