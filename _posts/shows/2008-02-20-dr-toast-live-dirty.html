<p>Friday, February 22, 2008 - My thanks to <a href="http://www.false-profit.com/2008/02/22/dirty/" target="_blank">False Profit</a>'s public relations agency for fabricating this choice quote from me: Reached for comment waterskiing in Dubai, James Reynolds, False Profit’s Executive VP of Whomptronics offered this bit of advice: “We’re unabashedly suggesting all investors should fill out their portfolios with a selection of DIRTY beats, funked-up breaks, seismic wobbles, gritty textures and filthy, nasty, sexed-up basslines, as every player in this dynamic segment is poised to thrive mightily.” 10pm, $10, DNA Lounge - <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=375%2011th%20st%20sf%20ca" title="google maps" target="_blank">375 11th St</a> @ Harrison, San Francisco.</p>
