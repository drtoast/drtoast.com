<p>Friday, July 25 through Sunday, July 27 - Dr. Toast plays a special set by the pond on Friday night at the 12th annual <a href="http://fnforg.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Friends and Family campout</a> in Mendocino County, CA. Comfy chill space, firelight and more. Camp &amp; Sons is a beautiful retreat, complete with a communal kitchen, a pond, orchards, three hot tubs (two of which are wood-fired), a well-maintained lawn area for lounging, beautiful gardens, outdoor showers, and much more. Hope to see you there!</p>
