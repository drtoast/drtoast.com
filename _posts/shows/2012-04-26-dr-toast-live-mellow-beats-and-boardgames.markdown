**Thursday, April 26, 7-11:30pm** - Come enjoy music from Dr. Toast, Ganucheau, Hickory, Daps and more as you enjoy old-school boardgames and delicious cocktails.  From the good folks at [Langon Labs][langton_labs]: "You play games, we play beats. Grab a snack, have a drink, bring a tasty treat, chat with new and old friends, everyone has a good time. Play our games (Scrabble, Boggle, Settlers of Catan, Dominion, Connect Four, Race for the Galaxy, Apples to Apples, etc) or bring your own. Come on in, we're all friends here." \[[facebook]\]
