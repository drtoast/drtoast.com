<p>Wow. From <a href="http://www.mcphee.com/items/11831.html" target="_blank">Archie McPhee:</a> "Toast is great, but it’s hard to keep in your pocket. So what do you do when you crave the warm comfort of toast but don’t want to deal with the crumbs? You pull out your Inflatable Toast, blow it up and admire its realistic toasty goodness! Each soft vinyl slice of toast is 6" tall and has a standard inflation valve." <a href="http://www.mcphee.com/items/11831.html" target="_blank">Get yours today!</a></p>
