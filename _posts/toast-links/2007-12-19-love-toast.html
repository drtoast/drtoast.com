By now I'm sure most of you are familiar with that great Heywood Banks song, "<a href="http://www.drtoast.com/crumbs/100" title="Yeah Toast">Yeah Toast!</a>"  Well, what you may not know is that way back in 1984, a band by the name of The Lemmings wrote their own slightly darker song about toast. <a href="http://chris.fakescience.com/music/Toast.mp3" title="Love Toast!" target="_blank">Listen!</a>

"You say you love me.  You need me.  You like toast
But I watch your movements and I can see that you lie
I'm with you.  I watch you.  I notice you.
Now I know that you don't like toast at all...

<!--more-->

Each time I'm near you I love you
love toast, love toast!
But when you're away I get angry
t-t-t-t-t-t-t-TOAST!
I want to be deep inside of you
love toast, love toast!
But you just don't see it that way
t-t-t-t-t-t-t-TOAST!

You're always.  A kissin'.  My best friend.
When we're at breakfast, you say you'd rather have pancakes
I touch you.  Ah but only.  On the week nights.
Each day I watch you burning up toast in my toaster

Each time I'm near you I love you
love toast, love toast!
Love you but then I get angry
t-t-t-t-t-t-t-TOAST!
I want to be deep inside of you
love toast, love toast!
But you just don't see it that way
t-t-t-t-t-t-t-TOAST!

I watch you.  Eat all of.  The corn flakes.
You are the reason I eat my toast every morning.
Hey I love you.  I love you.  Oh yes I really do.
I watch your blood, cover my section of sidewalk

Each time I'm near you I love you
love toast, love toast!
But when you're away I get angry
t-t-t-t-t-t-t-TOAST!
I want to be deep inside of you
love toast, love toast!
But you just don't see it that way
Never did"
