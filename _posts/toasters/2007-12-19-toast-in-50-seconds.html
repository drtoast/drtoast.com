The modern toaster takes an average of 141 seconds to make toast.  I personally like to make use of this time to close my eyes, breathe deeply of the gently wafting aroma, perhaps compose a new <a href="http://drtoast.com/departments/toast-haiku" title="Toast Haiku">toast haiku</a> or two.  But if you're the busy high-powered executive type for whom an extra 90 seconds means just enough time to cancel the office Christmas party or to fire an underperforming subordinate or two, this <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/technology/technology.html?in_article_id=503333&amp;in_page_id=1965" title="Turbo Toaster" target="_blank">Turbo Toaster</a> boasts toast in under a minute by blowing superheated air onto that bewildered slice from two directions at once.  Then you can gobble down your toast and conquer the world!  Huzzah!
