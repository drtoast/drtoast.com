For thousands of years we have had clock radios, toaster ovens, ovens with clocks.... but why not a toaster with a radio built in?  Finally, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kenwood-TT756SL-2-Slice/dp/B000AANXG8/sr=1-1/qid=1155001344/ref=sr_1_1/002-3579427-2078405?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden">such a thing has come to pass</a>.  I only wish they had taken it to the next logical step - a toaster alarm clock radio, gently waking you with the comforting smell of fresh toast.  But then, perhaps sleepily reaching for the snooze alarm and thusly putting your fumbly digits in a burning hot toaster might not be so good.
