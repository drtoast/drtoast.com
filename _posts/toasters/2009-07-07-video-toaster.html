<p>Back in the early 90s, a product called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Toaster" target="_blank">Video Toaster</a> was introduced that allowed folks to do high-quality video editing and special effects with inexpensive Amiga home computers. Almost 20 years later, an industrious fellow named Lemonie gives us instructions on how to convert an old VCR into a Video Toaster that <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How_to_make_a_VHS_video_toaster/" target="_blank">actually toasts bread</a> (minus the video editing, and with the addition of the extreme danger of fire or electrocution). You can learn how on <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How_to_make_a_VHS_video_toaster/" target="_blank">Instructibles.com</a>.</p>
