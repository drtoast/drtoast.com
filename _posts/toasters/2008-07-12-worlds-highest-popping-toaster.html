<p>Did you know there is an official Guinness world record for "Highest Popping Toaster"? Well, meet the new record holder - the CO2 gas powered "<a href="http://www.freddieyauner.co.uk/index.php?/news/the-highest-popping-toaster-in-the-world/" target="_blank">Moaster</a>". An account of the successful record-breaking attempt can be found at <a href="http://digital-lifestyles.info/2008/06/25/highest-popping-toaster-exclusive-video-and-slow-mo-of-record/" target="_blank">Digital Lifestyles</a>. And while the folks at Guinness recorded the trajectory at just 8.5 feet, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dgXqZtYmKA" target="_blank">video</a> shows that it actually appears to go several stories higher than that.</p>
