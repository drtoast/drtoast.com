<p><img style="float:left; margin-right: 15px;" src="/uploads/2011/01/chinese_wikipedia_logo.png" width="135" height="163" alt="chinese_wikipedia_logo.png" /> Way back near the beginning of my illustrious career, I posted on this blog my original research <a href="http://www.drtoast.com/crumbs/8" target="_blank">on the history of the toaster</a>.</p>
<p>(Briefly: it was accidentally invented in 1491 by an obscure French alchemist named Gerard Depardieu, who was actually trying to turn bread into gold. He also had to invent plastic and electricity.)</p>
<p>In 2008, the Chinese version of the Wikipedia article on toast cited this research as fact. It remained on Wikipedia for over two years before it was finally removed by overzealous "truthists."</p>
<p><a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E5%90%90%E5%8F%B8&amp;oldid=12095665" target="_blank" title="Chinese ">Here's how it looked in 2010</a>: (apparently there is no Chinese character for "Gerard Depardieu")</p>
