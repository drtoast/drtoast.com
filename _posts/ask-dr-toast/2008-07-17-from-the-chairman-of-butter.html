<p><strong>Q:</strong> Thank you for your outstanding efforts to produce quality toast. You are an inspiration to all beings in the universe that appreciate the finer aspects of toast. We here at B.U.T.T.E.R. regard your presence as an indication that the cosmic collective consciousness is swinging towards equilibrium, and soon toast will be understood and appreciated for its universal relevance. Please keep up the good work and know that we will be watching for all future developments.<br /></p>
<p>Thank You,</p>
<p>G. Blandston (_____@butter.net)<br />
Chairman,<br />

<p><strong>A</strong>: Dear Chairman Blandston,</p>
<p>And thank <em>you</em> for your kind and encouraging words. It's important and challenging work that we do here at the University of Toast, and even with my lofty and intimidating title of Doctor of Toastronomical Sciences, there is still so much left for me to learn about toast, and indeed about myself, before my work is complete. I am honored, and only a little bit creeped out, to know that you will continue to monitor my work in the future, and I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with your Bureau in its own endeavors, without any of those pesky restraining orders.</p>
<p>Warmest Regards,</p>
<p>Dr. Toast</p>
