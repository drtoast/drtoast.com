Q: I have no questions to ask of your high intellect, as I have seen the light, and I live in the perpetual glow of toast. You may know me as the High Priest of Buttermilk Wheat, guardian of <a href="http://www.teleport.com/~cramsay/shrine.html">The Shrine to Toast</a>. My busy schedule of preaching the Word to the masses has kept me from doing research on virtual toast, so this is the first time I have stumbled upon your words of wisdom. I enjoyed your page very much and you will recieve an honorable mention on my page of links which I will be updating this weekend.

Keep up the good work.

<!--more-->A: Celeste, I am truly honored that Her Toastiness would bestow such words on so humble a purveyor of savoir-toast as myself. While I specialize in the intellectual and philosophical aspects of toast, the spirituality of toast is undeniably of utmost importance to an individual's inner harmony. Therefore, I encourage my readers to visit The Shrine often, and read the Words therein so that they too might be enlightened.

-- Dr. Toast
