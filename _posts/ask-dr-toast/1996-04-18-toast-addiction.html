Q: Dr. Toast, is there such a thing as having an addiction to toast? I can't seem to get through my day without eating a slice of warm toast in the morning, and this really scares me, Doc.  And if so, is there a support group out there that can help me?

<!--more-->A: Skippy, I'm afraid the addiction to toast is an extremely real and frighteningly common phenomenon.

The sad truth of the matter, Skippy, is that we are ALL hopelessly, permanently, and incurably addicted to toast.  However, we should be thankful, for a healthy addiction to toast keeps us safe from the devastating effects of toast's only alternative: street drugs.

Unfortunately, it has come to my attention recently that many of America's young folks are in fact choosing these street drugs over toast.  This can be attributed directly to a lack of toast education.  So for all you kiddies reading this, I give you this Netscape-Enhanced table comparing toast and crack:

Say "NO" to Drugs!  Say "YES" to Toast!

-- Dr. Toast

P.S. -- Obviously, since we are all toast addicts, there are no formal toast support groups.  Just eat a slice and watch "Melrose Place" or something.
