<br />
Radiant textures and melodies over deep, head-nodding beats and dirty analog basslines - the perfect soundtrack for a midnight drive through the desert. Over three years in the making, "The Wave Function" is the result of my continuing immersion in San Francisco music and art communities. My eyes and ears are always being turned on to something new and strange and beautiful, and I hope you'll be able to hear some of that in these songs. I am eternally thankful for all of the support and encouragement that has made this music possible, and I hope you'll enjoy listening as much as I've enjoyed making it.
